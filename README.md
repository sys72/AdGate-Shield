## ⚡ What is AdGate Shield?

**AdGate Shield (AGS Block)** is a professional tool designed to filter your internet traffic directly on your device. 

Think of it as a **digital firewall**: it sits between your apps and the internet, blocking ads, trackers, and malicious sites *before* they even load.

### 🚀 Why do you need it?

| 🟢 For Everyone (Simplicity) | 🔴 For Techs (Power) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Plug & Play:** Just one button to activate. No complex setup. | **Kotlin Native:** Re-engineered engine for raw performance. |
| **Save Data:** Don't waste 4G/5G loading video ads. | **Local Loopback:** Zero-latency filtering without external servers. |
| **Better Battery:** Silent operation designed for AMOLED screens. | **Privacy First:** No logs, no data collection. |

## 🔒 Security & Privacy (The Technical Part)
AdGate Shield operates by creating a **local VPN interface**. 
- **No External Servers:** Your data never leaves your phone to be filtered in a cloud. Everything happens inside your CPU.
- **DNS Filtering:** We use strictly selected rules (AdGuard Base) to ensure maximum blocking efficiency with minimal breakage.
- **OneUI/MIUI Persistence:** Custom algorithms to prevent system aggressive battery savers from killing the protection.
